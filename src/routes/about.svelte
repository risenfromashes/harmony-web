            Harmony is a social network for students to collaborate each other.
            It is a place where students can share their knowledge and
            experience and also can discuss the topics that they are interested
            in. We expect Harmony to be the hub of the studentsâ€™ academic
            enthusiasm and excellence.

            For now, Harmony is going to be confined to BUET students. We want
            to benchmark it as much as possible before making it more open.

          What is the difference between Harmony and Moodle?

            Harmony is mainly for collaboration among students, whereas Moodle
            is for teachers to conduct the academic activities. So, you have
            probably guessed it already, on the platform Harmony, there will not
            be any teachers present.

            Well Facebook is detrimental for study whereas Harmony is the exact
            opposite. It will create a study-friendly virtual environment for
