          Harmony is a social network for students to collaborate each other. It
          is a place where students can share their knowledge and experience and
          also can discuss the topics that they are interested in. We expect
          Harmony to be the hub of the studentsâ€™ academic enthusiasm and
          excellence.

          benchmark it as much as possible before making it more open.

          Harmony is mainly for collaboration among students, whereas Moodle is
          for teachers to conduct the academic activities. So, you have probably
          guessed it already, on the platform Harmony, there will not be any
          teachers present.
